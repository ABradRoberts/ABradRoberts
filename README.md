Just a hacker trying to make a name for myself.

I am passionate about cyber security specifically related to offensive security including penetration testing, red team engagements, and have built and participated in purple team engagements.

I have developed a solid understanding of common Amazon Web Services and security best practices for each. I enjoy writing scripts in Python3, BASH, and occasionally C/C++. I believe in continuous growth and have made a goal for myself to learn a new programming language this year, Go, and to strengthen my knowledge of Docker, which is currently limited.

Check out my personal website, lately I have been trying my hand at HackTheBox writeups and book reviews, any feedback is gladly welcome! - https://ABradRoberts.GitHub.io
